## Setup

1. Clone repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run build` to build `src/render.tsx` to `dist/render.js`
4. Run `npm run execute:script` to execute `dist/render.js` with Node.js

One can also run `npm run execute` to combine the `build` and `execute:script` commands. This will build the script and execute it in one command.
